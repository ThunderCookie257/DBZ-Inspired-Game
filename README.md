# DBZ-Inspired-Game
This is my DBZ inspired pygame 2-player game.
I used pygame to create this game. Features include a game loop, collision detection, movement
Possible Updates: Beam clashes (events when the blasts collide with each other),
                  Leader/Scoreboard,
                  Additional Attacks
